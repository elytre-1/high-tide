# high-tide

Your little planetary system is getting invaded! Help your planet to get rid of these water robbers by generating colossal tides.

Use the RIGHT and LEFT arrows of your keyboard to move around your planet. Then, press the UP arrow to generate tides and destroy ennemy ships. Otherwise, they will pump the entire ocean down!
